            <h2>A Little About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Theresa. 
                I've always wanted a career in something that would interest and challenge me. I've always been passioniate
                and curious about everything I do. Once I learn something and understand it, I'm ready for the next challenge.
                It took me a while to find something that I was interested in that I would want to pursue as a career and that is coding.
                Each day I'm so excited about the things that I learn. I come from a background of no tech and I put myself out there and 
                decided now or never was the time. This has been the best learning experience of my life so far. I can't wait to keep learning
                and growing as a person.
            </p>
            <p>I have always been the type of person that loves to travel and learn. I was born in Southfield, Michigan but I grew up in Detroit.
                Eventually we moved from there when I was 8 years old and we moved to Livonia. I loved where I lived but I decided it was time for 
                a change and decided to move to Wheeling, West Virginia when I was 20 years old. I lived there for about 3 years until I moved back 
                home to Michigan. I've been at my current job for a little over three years now, but I cannot wait to find a career in Tech. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is really important to find something you're passionate about. I have a few passions myself that keep me motivated in life. I have a passion
                for music. I love a variety of all kinds of music. I try to listen to as much new stuff as possible. I want to find something that can challenge 
                me like I challenge myself with music. I know that sounds crazy, but all my life music has been there for me. Learning how to develope and code 
                has really opened my eyes on how I can mix business with pleasure. I was not sure if I would ever be able to come up with little projects learning
                C#.NET, but the more I grow and learn as a junior developer the more I realize that I can be creative with my ideas of how to do things, the more 
                exited I get as a devloper.

            <p>
                So ready for my new future!
