    <p class = "bio">I'm passionate about everything I do. I never back down from a challenge or goal. If I fail, I don't give that a reason for 
        me to quit or give up. I will get up, dust off my boots, and get back in there. I'm dedicated to what I do and I never want to
        stop learning and growing!
